Hey there! Super thrilled you've hopped onto my GitHub island. You can shout out to me as JACK, or go with jackgao for that full username experience. My name is Gao Jian, and I am a junior at Tsinghua University, currently enrolled in Weiyang College. I am spinning two plates with degrees in Mathematical and Fundamental Sciences as well as Energy & Power Engineering. My research interests are focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), under the advisory of Prof. Ji Wu and Prof. Miao Li. where I have gained substantial experience in model pre-training and fine-tuning.

In my current research, I concentrate on the learning capabilities and memory patterns of language models, the attention mechanisms of transformer models, and their capacity for in-context learning. I am in the process of preparing a submission for the COLM conference in March.

My future research aspirations include exploring attention transfer within various model sizes. If you have any inquiries or are interested in discussing potential collaborations, please do not hesitate to contact me at gaojian21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn. I am open to engaging in meaningful dialogues and welcome the opportunity to collaborate on impactful projects. Can't wait to chat or team up for some epic adventures in tech!



<!-- Hey there! Super thrilled you've hopped onto my GitHub island. If you're feeling extra, give my Chinese name, 高健 (Gao Jian), a whirl!

I'm a third-year enthusiast at Tsinghua University's Wuyuan College, spinning two plates with degrees in Mathematical and Fundamental Sciences and Energy & Power Engineering. Right now, I'm knee-deep in the NLP (Natural Language Processing) sandbox, playing around with model pre-training and fine-tuning.

I'm all about digging into how language models learn and remember, how transformer models pay attention, and how they get smart with in-context learning. I'm also on the starting blocks to pitch my work at the COLM conference come March.

Looking down the road, I'm jazzed about pushing the envelope on how models, big or small, pass the attention baton. Got questions? Wanna chat or join forces on a cool project? Hit me up at gaojian21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn. Can't wait to chat or team up for some epic adventures in tech! -->
