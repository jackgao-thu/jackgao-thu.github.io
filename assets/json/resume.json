      "summary": "I studied the attention characteristics and common features of models when trained on long sentences with six pieces of information. The findings indicate a strong positive correlation between the size of the model parameters, the attention weight given to key information such as names, and the accuracy of the model in answering questions. By manually controlling the attention allocation within the llama2-7B model to enhance the attention on key information like names or to reduce the attention on irrelevant information like punctuation, I successfully demonstrated that adjusting attention can significantly improve the training outcomes for information positioned later in the six pieces of information, with the best results mirroring the effects of training on short sentences with single pieces of information. Now we are working on attention based self-reflection training, aimed at making LLMs work well on knowledge memory functions.",
